        <p>Access VHB’s 20-plus libraries and borrow materials using your VHB ID card, which also gives your spouse or partner access. Dependent children can enter with a visitor's pass. Minors (under the age of 18) must be accompanied by an adult or legal guardian at all times. At the libraries, minors are not eligible to purchase fee-based library cards or registration as a visitor. In addition to their world-class collection of physical and digital works, Stanford libraries host exhibits and events, including conferences and cultural nights.</p>

        <p>Keep balconies and patios clear—do not use tarps or awnings, and do not store items, even briefly.
            Please do not attach awnings, tarps or screens to any Student Housing property, including exterior buildings, fences, and trees.
            Exterior storage units in good condition may be used but they must be made of high-density plastic or non-chewable material, must be lockable, and may not exceed the height of the patio fence (less than 42" in height).
            Do not attach anything to or hang anything from patio fences, wood awnings, or windows except well-maintained plants or wind chimes.
            Hot tubs, saunas, and pools of any size are not allowed within or outside the residences.
            Keep well-maintained potted gardens on patios; do not plant directly in the ground, and please do not put plants in common areas.</p>

        <p>Before COVID-19 changed our world forever, people did not have a choice about working from an office or attending a class in school.  Universities had a brief fascination with the MOOC, Massive Open Online Coursesas an educational panacea, but student performance in those classes rarely equated to earning a degree. Hopes for the potential of transformative online education were tempered. Pre-pandemic, in-person events dominated occasions for gathering, from business conferences to university classes. Collaboration and conferencing in-person were requisite.</p>
